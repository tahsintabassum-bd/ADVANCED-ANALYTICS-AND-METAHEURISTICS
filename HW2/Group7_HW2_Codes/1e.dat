# I ignored both of Ms. Bollman and Thomas. They fall for the sunk-cost fallacy.
# We already bought the grapes, so we should not include their "cost" as a limitationn when deciding how to maximize profits.
# Maximizing profits is a question of things we can change, and restrictions we have to follow. 
# The restriciton of "quality" is just there to produce different types of products.
# It is not going to add costs to sell some type or another. 
# This is why I used Ms. Bollman's variable cost (without fruit cost).
# Note that  Ms. Bollman's cost is equal to Thomas's if we ignore fruit costs.
